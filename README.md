### Learning Goals

## Inspiration
I always wanted to make a story telling game about someone who is in this dreadful situation...
A pit of despair. Someone who can't fight back but only run and hide.
I want to make a game that makes you the player decide the story.
Depending on those choises good things can happen and it can all disappear.
This experience is supposed be very grim and unsaturated. 

## Software Analysis  


### Unity  

Unity is an extremely user friendly engine made for beginners as well as experienced developers, it has many tools and since the new update it's only gotten better and more powerfull. shader graph is an easy way to create amazing shaders using nodes and unity also had a tool vor node based programming. the UI is about as flexible as it gets and since Unity 2019.1 there is also UIElements as a public API which allowes developers to make the UI look any way they want. The components in unity are simple to use to make collision, sound and GUI very easy to implement.

| Pro's | Con's |

| Quick and easy learning curve | Over simplified UI |
| Automatic Memory management (C#) | some areas lack documentation |
| Build to any platform | Very slow later in development |

### Unreal

| Pro's | Con's |
| --- | --- |
| Lot's of flexibility and control | More difficult to learn |
| Great level design tools | Less online tutorials and documentation |
| Open source | smaller community |

### JavaScript

| Pro's | Con's |
| --- | --- |
| Simple and fast to learn and use | Security |
| Cross platform | Browser Interpretation |
| Excellent documentation and community | Rely on libraries |
