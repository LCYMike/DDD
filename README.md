## Inspiration
I always wanted to make a story telling game about someone who is in this dreadful situation...
A pit of despair. someone who can't fight back but only run and hide.
I want to make a game that makes you the player decide the story.
Depending on those choises good things can happen and it can all disapear.
This experience is supposed be very grim and desaturated.
