# D.D.D.
Small Storytelling Game

## Game Description
D.D.D. is a game where you follow someone trough their live and see how it starts and ends.
Some stories can be sad and unfair while others are just your average old man who just got old but didn't have the best ending. 

### Planning

## Inspiration
I always wanted to make a story telling game and have had a lot of idea's.
I though about how you always hear about death on TV, depression at school.
I tried putting myself in someone's shoes, someone who is in this dreadful situation...
A pit of despair.

I want to make a game that makes you the player decide how you live your live.
Work up to something just to have something terrible happen and see it all disapear.
This experience may be be very dark desaturated and emotional.
