# D.D.D.
Small Storytelling Game

## Game Description
D.D.D. is a game where you follow someone trough their live and see how it starts and ends.

## My Inspiration
I always wanted to make a story telling game and have had dozons of idea's.
One day I though about how you always hear about death on TV, depression at school.
I tried putting myself in someone's shoes, someone who is in this dreadful situation...
A pit of despair.

I want to make a game that makes you the player decide how you live your live.
Work up to something just to have something shitty happen and see it all dissapear.
This experience is going to be very dark, desaturated and emotional.
